        Gas-fired combi boiler
        ---
        In many homes in the Netherlands, the combi-boiler is the default
        technology for producing heat and hot water. Although this technology
        uses gas quite efficiently, it still emits CO<sub>2</sub>. This could 
        pose a problem if you want to reduce emissions significantly.

        Micro-CHP 
        ---
        The micro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) unit is a tiny gas-fired 
        heat and power plant for use in your house. Using a micro-CHP can 
        deliver significant energy savings. Because this technology is 
        relatively new, it is quite expensive.

        Ground source heat pump
        ---
        A heat pump is like a refrigerator used the other way around: it pumps
        heat into the house from outside, while a refrigerator pumps heat out
        of its own insides. Heat pumps reduce your need for gas to
        heat the house.

        Incandescent lighting
        ---
        Many EU countries will ban the incandescent light bulb in the future.
        They only convert about 2-3% of the energy used into visible light.
        The rest is radiated as heat. Compared to newer technologies, 
        incandescent light bulbs do not live very long. An advantage 
        is that they tend to give off a 'warm' light.
        <br/><br/>
        Fluorescent lighting
        ---
        Fluorescent lights produce light by sending an electric charge 
        through a rarified gas that is contained in a tube. A typical 
        fluorescent light converts electricity into visible light 10 
        times more efficiently than the traditional incandescent lamp still
        used in many homes. The lights are usually also more expensive, but 
        the higher costs are offset by much longer
        lifetimes and lower electricity bills.

        LED lighting
        ---
        LED lights are 50% more efficient than conventional fluorescent lights.
        Unlike fluorescent lights, LEDs can be switched on and off often 
        without decreasing their lifetime. LED lighting costs 
        5 to 50 times more than for fluorescent tubes. Their 
        longer life and lower electricity use will in the end make the LED 
        light cheaper.
