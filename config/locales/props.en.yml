    co2_emissions:
      name: "CO2 Emissions"
      header: "You emit (Q:total_co2_emissions) of CO<sub>2</sub>"
      body: |-
        When fuel is burnt by cars, heaters or power plants, they emit carbon
        dioxide. Scientists assume a big increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions during the last 200 years are responsible for global 
        warming and melting polar ice caps.

        Try to reduce this number to get a higher score, but you cannot get to
        zero, because some emissions (for example from trucks, industry,
        etcetera) cannot be influenced with sliders here. (If you want, 
        try to further decrease this number in the free professional version 
        of the ETM.)

    costs:
      name: "Costs"
      header: "You spend (Q:total_costs) on energy every year!"
      body: |-
        This includes costs for building and installing the devices that use energy.

    etflex_score:
      name: "Score"
      header: "You score (Q:score) points"
      body: |-
        Your score goes up when you decrease costs, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        and nuclear waste, and when you increase renewabilty and reliability.
        Relying too much on one technology or option decreases your score.
        Good balance between supply and demand increases it.

    reliability:
      name: "Reliability"
      header:
        'on':  "You have a reliable energy supply!"
        'off': "Oh no, your current settings will leave you in the dark now and then!"
      body: |-
        Renewable power is less predictable than power from (fossil) power
        plants, because sometimes there is no wind or sunshine. This means you
        cannot be sure to have power, unless you manage to store it somewhere
        or have a backup plan.

    renewability:
      header: "(Q:renewability) of your energy is renewable"
      body: |-
        Do you want to produce more renewable energy? Then build more
        wind and solar or add more green gas to your gas network.

        If you want to increase the number above 20%, you will need to go to
        the free professional version of the ETM in order to adjust settings
        in other sectors, such as transportation and industry.

          In the current situation there are only (Q:number_of_electric_cars)
          electric cars in the Netherlands in 2030. If you want to increase the
          number to more than a million, try to see what percentage of electric
          cars you need.
