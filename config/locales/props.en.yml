    co2_emissions:
      header: "Your country emits (Q:total_co2_emissions) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>"
      body:   "When fuel is burnt by cars, heaters or power plants, they emit carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
               A big increase in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the last two 
               centuries, is widely assumed to be responsible for global warming and melting
               polar ice caps.

               This number cannot become zero, because some emissions (for example from 
               trucks, industry, etcetera) cannot be influenced here."

    costs:
      header: "Your country spends (Q:total_costs) billion euros on energy every year"
      body:   "This includes all
               the energy used to make exported products and the exported energy itself."

    score:
      header:  "You score (Q:etflex_score) points"
      body:    "Your score goes up when you decrease costs, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 
               nuclear waste, and when you increase renewabilty and reliability. Relying too 
               much on one technology or option decreases your score. Good balance between 
               supply and demand increases it."

    reliability:
      header:
        on:    "You have a reliable energy supply"
        off:   "You face blackouts now and then with your current set-up"
      body:    "Renewable power is less predictable than power from power plants, and sometimes there
                is no wind or sunshine. This means you cannot be sure to have power, unless
                you manage to store it somewhere or have a backup plan."

    renewability:
      header:  "(Q:renewability)% of your energy is renewable"
      body:    "This number increases if you manage to lower energy use while increasing
                renewable heat and power production
                
                If you want to increase the number above 20%, you will need to go to the
                (free) professional version of the ETM."
