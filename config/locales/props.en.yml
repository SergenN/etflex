    co2_emissions:
      header: "You emit (Q:total_co2_emissions) tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>"
      body: |-
        When fuel is burnt by cars, heaters or power plants, they emit carbon
        dioxide. A big increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the last
        200 years is assumed to be responsible for global warming and melting
        polar ice caps by scientists.

        Try to reduce this number to get a higher score, but you cannot get to
        zero, because some emissions (for example from trucks, industry,
        etcetera) cannot be influenced with sliders here. (You might want to
        go to the professional model of the ETM to try to further decrease
        this number.)

    costs:
      header: "You spend (Q:total_costs) euros on energy every year!"
      body: |-
        This includes all the energy used to make exported products and the
        exported energy itself.

    score:
      header: "You score (Q:etflex_score) points"
      body: |-
        Your score goes up when you decrease costs, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        and nuclear waste, and when you increase renewabilty and reliability.
        Relying too much on one technology or option decreases your score.
        Good balance between supply and demand increases it.

    reliability:
      header:
        'on':  "You have a reliable energy supply!"
        'off': "Oh no, you'll be in the dark now and then with your current set-up!"
      body: |-
        Renewable power is less predictable than power from (fossil) power
        plants, because sometimes there is no wind or sunshine. This means you
        cannot be sure to have power, unless you manage to store it somewhere
        or have a backup plan."

    renewability:
      header: "(Q:renewability) of your energy is renewable."
      body: |-
        Do you want to produce more renewable types of energy? Then build more
        wind, solar or add more green gas to your gas network.

        If you want to increase the number above 20%, you will need to go to
        the (free) professional version of the ETM in order to adjust setting
        in other sectors, such as transportationa and the industry."

          In your scenario, there are more than a million electric cars in the
          Netherlands in 2040! Electric cars will be abundantly visible in the
          streets.
        suv: |-
          In the current situation there are only (Q:number_of_electric_cars)
          electric cars and X.XX million fossil-fueled cars in the Netherlands
          in 2040. If you want to change the division, try to increase the
          percentage of electric cars to see the impact.'
