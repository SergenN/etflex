    transport_cars_electric_share: |-
      An electric car uses 2 to 3 times less energy than a diesel or gasoline
      -powered car. Diesel and gasoline are made from oil. By switching to 
      electric cars, we will save a lot of oil but at the same time use more 
      electricity. If we generate this electricity using wind turbines or 
      solar power, driving a car will no longer produce any CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions. If we make this electricity with modern coal or gas-fired 
      power plants electric cars will still emit less fossil-fueled ones, 
      but only a bit because coal en gas-fired power plants also emit CO<sub>2</sub>.

    households_behavior_standby_killer_turn_off_appliances: |-
      We own more and more electrical appliances that are often left on when 
      they are not being used. By switching off these appliances we can save power.

    number_of_coal_conventional: |-
      A coal-fired power plant runs at full capacity most of the time. 
      Turning it off regularly reduces the amount of electricity that can
      be obtained from an given amount of coal. Coal plants are the most 
      polluting of all power production options. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are
      roughly twice that of a gas-fired plant.

    number_of_gas_conventional: |-
      A gas-fired power plant is cheaper to build than a coal power plant. 
      However, power from gas costs more than power plants that burn coal. 
      A gas-fired power plant is easily powered up or down. That can come 
      in handy when wind turbines are not turning for a lack of wind. 
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are half that of a coal-fired power plant.

    number_of_wind_onshore_land: |-
      A wind turbine produces renewable power. There are no CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions. Wind is its fuel; it is a fuel which does not run out. Of 
      course, the wind does not always blow. This means that building 
      windmills alone is not enough. You would have a problem if you 
      needed power and there was no wind. A lot of effort is currently 
      being put into making wind turbines cheaper.

    households_hot_water_micro_chp_share: |-
      The micro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) unit is a tiny gas-fired 
      heat and power plant for domestic use. Future micro CHPs will supply 
      less heat, because they are meant to be used in well-insulated houses. 
      In 2050 they are mostly suited for supplying hot water and no longer 
      for space heating.
      The combination of heat and electricity makes this option quite energy 
      efficient, especially in houses that have a large heat demand. The 
      micro-CHP replaces the gas-fired central heating boiler. The heat 
      produced is used for heating building spaces or water. If not all 
      produced electricity is used, it is delivered back to the electricity 
      grid, just like with solar panels.

    households_insulation_level_old_houses: |-
      A house uses a lot less energy for heating in winter, if it is insulated 
      and airtight. Insulation prevents heat leaking through windows, walls, 
      floors and ceilings. Airtightness prevents the wind blowing cold air into 
      the house and pushing the warm air out. The more airtight a house is, the 
      more actively you need to control the inner climate of the house. In order 
      to be very energy efficient houses always need to be super insulated and 
      airtight.

    households_lighting_light_emitting_diode_share: |-
      Incandescent light bulbs waste a lot of energy. The power they consume 
      is mostly turned into heat instead of light. That is why, in Europe, we 
      will all shift to low-energy lighting in the coming years. These new 
      light bulbs emit the same amount of light and do not become so warm. They 
      even last much longer than traditional light bulbs!

    households_hot_water_fuel_cell_share: |-
      This is a so-called Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). Fuel cells are 
      electrochemical conversion devices that produce electricity directly 
      from oxidizing a fuel. Fuel cells are highly efficient and besides 
      electricity, also produce heat.
      This fuel cell uses gas but is somewhat flexible when it comes to the 
      kind of fuel it uses. The largest disadvantage is that is operates at 
      high temperatures (500 - 1000 Â°C), which results in longer start-up 
      times. In households this is not a problem as they are basically 
      constantly running, producing warm water that is stored in a container 
      until it is needed.
      This device provides more electricity than a typical household needs, 
      turning its owner into a net electricity producer.

    households_heating_heat_pump_ground_share: |-
      A heat pump is like a refrigerator used the other way around: it pumps 
      heat into the house from outside, while a refrigerator pumps heat outside 
      of its own insides. Heat pumps make sure that you need a lot less gas to 
      heat the house. This is a good thing; we want to save that gas since it 
      will not be available for ever.

    households_hot_water_solar_water_heater_share: |-
      A solar water heater uses heat from the sun to make warm water. This is 
      often done on the roof of a house. The hot water can then be used for 
      showering or washing dishes, for example. By using the suns heat, we 
      need a lot less energy to make hot water.

    number_of_pulverized_coal: |-
      A coal-fired power plant burns coals to boil water and turn it into very 
      hot steam. This steam is used to drive a generator and produce 
      electricity. 
      These plants are less suitable to act as backup plants for wind- and solar 
      electricity than gas-fired plants, because they are expensive to build and 
      cheap to run. For this reason coal-fired power plants are almost always 
      running, producing electricity at maximum power. Out of all power plants, 
      this one has the highest CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions, about twice a much as a 
      gas-fired power plant. Wood can be co-fired in coal plants, to reduce such 
      emissions and raise renewability.

    number_of_gas_ccgt: |-
      A gas-fired power plant is cheaper to build than a coal power plant. But 
      usually gas is so expensive and coal so cheap that it is cheaper to produce 
      electricity with a coal-fired power plant. A gas-fired power plant can be 
      turned up and down easier than a coal-fired or nuclear power plant. 
      Therefore these plants can act as backup plants for wind- and solar power. 
      That can come in handy when there is no wind and solar panels do not 
      produce electricity because the sun is not shining. CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions of a gas-fired power plant are half that of a coal-fired 
      power plant.

    number_of_nuclear_3rd_gen: |-
      A nuclear power plant is very expensive to build. They last 
      a really long time and they use only small amounts of fuel (uranium). 
      Once the power plant has been built, making electricity is cheap. 
      That is why this type of power plant is almost always running. It 
      cannot be used to balance the supply and demand of electricity when 
      wind- and solar power vary with weather conditions. One advantage is 
      that there are almost no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The radioactive 
      waste is a disadvantage. No one has come up with a good solution for 
      this problem yet. On very rare occasions things can go horribly wrong 
      and the plants surroundings become unsuitable for living creatures for 
      a very long time. Fukushima or Chernobyl are striking examples. New 
      generations of nuclear power plants are designed to be much safer 
      than older types.

    number_of_wind_offshore: |-
      A wind turbine produces renewable power without CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions. Wind is its fuel; it is a fuel that does not run out, 
      although the wind does not always blow. This means that building 
      windmills alone is not enough. You would have a problem if you 
      needed power and there was no wind. A lot of effort is currently 
      being put into making wind turbines cheaper.

    households_market_penetration_solar_panels: |-
      Solar panels make electricity when they absorb sunlight. This also 
      works on cloudy days. As a result, it is easier to predict how much 
      power you can expect then it is with wind power. Of course, a solar 
      panel in sunny Spain produces more electricity than one in the United 
      Kingdom. You can install solar panels on the roof of your own house. 
      This is useful: it avoids power losses from transporting electricity 
      over a long cable. Solar panels are still quite expensive; a lot of 
      work is being put into making them cheaper.

    green_gas_total_share: |-
      Green gas is biogas that has been upgraded to natural gas quality. It 
      can be fed into the gas mains. Biogas is conventionally produced by 
      bacteria that digest biological material. In the future, such gas may 
      be produced by "gasification" of biomass.

    number_of_appliances_in_the_house: |-
      The number of household appliances (phones, media players, laptops etc.)
      that we own has been increasing steadily over the past years. Do you
      think this trend will continue in the future?

    comfort_temperature_in_the_house: |-
      Decreasing the setting on your thermostat by a couple of degrees lower 
      can save a lot of energy. On the other hand, if they can afford it 
      people tend to choose more comfort. What is your guess for our future 
      'comfort temperature'?
  
    daily_length_of_shower_per_person: |-
      Almost 80% of your daily hot water consumption is for showering. 
      Reducing the time the average person spends taking a shower (8 
      minutes) could save a lot of water. How long do you think a shower
      will take in the future?
  
    number_of_cold_showers_per_week: |-
      Taking one cold shower a week reduces your hot water consumption 
      by more than 10%. How many cold showers would you take per week?
      
    amount_of_insulation: |-
      Insulation is cheap and effective. The demand for heating or cooling
      depends on the level of insulation. 
      We have several options to better insulate our houses. The most important
      ones are roof, wall and floor insulation and insulated glazing.
      These four count for 75% of the total potential savings. The insulation
      level can be expressed as a 'thermal resistance' or Rc-value. 
      This is a measure for much resistance the building provides for escaping
      heat or cold. 
      So the higher the Rc-value, the better the insulation level of the 
      residence.
      For the Netherlands, the average Rc-value of old residences is about 1.
      This is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well insulated
      residences. For old residences it is difficult to go above an Rc-value 
      of 3.

    households_heating_solar_thermal_panels_share: |-
      Solar water heaters (SWH) use heat from the sun to produce warm water. 
      This warm water can be used for showering or for doing the dishes, etc.
      SWHs are usually installed on rooftops or in asphalt for parking lots. 
      A SWH is often combined with a gas-fired central heating boiler that 
      heats water further if necessary. It can also be combined with a heat 
      pump.
