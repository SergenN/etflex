      An electric car uses 2 to 3 times less energy than a diesel or gasoline-powered car. Diesel and gasoline are made from oil. By switching to electric cars, we will save a lot of oil but at the same time use more electricity. If we generate this electricity using wind turbines or solar power, driving a car will no longer produce any CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. If we make this electricity with modern coal or gas-fired power plants electric cars will still emit less fossil-fueled ones, but only a bit because coal en gas-fired power plants also emit CO<sub>2</sub>.
