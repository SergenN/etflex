      name: "Low-energy lighting"
      description: >
        Incandescent light bulbs waste a lot of energy. The power they consume
        is mostly turned into heat instead of light. That is why, in Europe,
        we will all shift to low-energy lighting in the coming years. These
        new light bulbs emit the same amount of light and do not become so
        warm. They even last much longer than traditional light bulbs!

      description: >
        An electric car uses 2 to 3 times less enegry than a diesel or
        gasoline-powered car. Diesel and gasoline are made from oil. By
        switching to electric cars, we will save a lot of oil and use a bit
        more electricity. If we generate this electricity using wind turbines
        or solar power, driving a car will no longer produce any CO2
        emissions.

      description: >
        Houses will lose a lot of energy because they have not been properly
        insulated. Of course, generating the energy we need in a sustainable
        way is a good idea. It is even better, though, to make sure we use
        less energy in the first place. A good way to do this is better
        insualtion for our homes.

    households_hot_water_solar_water_heater_share:
      name: "Solar water heater"
      description: >
        A solar water heater uses heat from the sun to make warm water. This
        is often done on the roof of a house. The hot water can then be used
        for showering or washing dishes, for example. By using the suns heat,
        we need a lot less energy to make hot water.

    households_behavior_standby_killer_turn_off_appliances:
      name: "Switch off appliances"
      description: >
        We own more and more electrical appliances which are often left on
        when they are not being used. By switching off these appliances we can
        save power.

    households_heating_heat_pump_ground_share:
      name: "Heat pump for the home"
      description: >
        A heat pump is like a refrigerator used the other way around: it pumps
        heat into the house from outside, while a refrigerator pumps heat
        outside of its own insides. Heat pumps make sure that you need a lot
        less gas to heat the house. This is a good thing; we want to save that
        gas since it will not be available for ever.

    number_of_coal_conventional:
      name: "Coal-fired power plants"
      description: >
        A coal-fired power plant is almost always running, producing
        electricity at maximum power. Powering it doen regularly reduces the
        amount of electricity we can make from coal. A coal-fired power plant
        produces more air polluation than any alternative. CO2 emissions are
        twice as high as for a gas-fired power plant.

    number_of_gas_conventional:
      name: "Gas-fired power plants"
      description: >
        A gas-fired power plant is cheaper to build than a coal power plant.
        However, they cost more than power plants which burn coal. A gas-fired
        power plant is easily powered up or down. That can come in handy when
        wind turbines are not turning for a lack of wind. CO2 emissions are
        half that of a coal-fired power plant.

    number_of_nuclear_3rd_gen:
      name: "Nuclear power plants"
      description: >
        A nuclear power plant is quite expensive to build. However, they do
        last a lot longer than power plants which burn gas or coal. Once the
        power plant has been built, making electricity is cheap. That is why
        this type of power plant is almost always running. It cannot be used
        to balance the supply and demand of electricity. One advantage is that
        there are almost no CO2 emissions. The radioactive waste is a
        disadvantage. No one has come up with a good solution for this problem
        yet.

    number_of_wind_onshore_land:
      name: "Wind turbines"
      description: >
        A wind turbine produces sustainable power. There are no CO2 emissions.
        Wind is its fuel; it is a fuel which does not run out. Of course, the
        wind does not always blow. This means that building windmills alone is
        not enough. You would have a problem if you needed power and there was
        no wind. A lot of effort is currently being put into making wind
        turbines cheaper.

    number_of_solar_pv_roofs_fixed:
      name: "Solar panels"
      description: >
        Solar panels make electricity when they absorb sublight. This also
        works on cloudy days. As a result, it is easier to predict how much
        power you can expect then it is with wind power. Of course, a solar
        panel in sunny Spain produces more electricity than one in the United
        Kingdom. You can install solar panels on the roof of your own house.
        This is useful: it avoids power losses from transporting electricity
        over a long cable. Solar panels are still quite expensive; a lot of
        work is being put into making them cheaper.

    policy_area_biomass:
      name: "Biomass"
      description: >
        Biomass in the remains of plans and trees (like hay, wood chips,
        branches, and saw dust). You can make power by burning biomass. An
        advantage is that biomass will never be exhausted, like coal or oil
        will. Of course, you do have to make sure to plant new trees and
        plants! CO2 is released into the air when you burn biomass. The good
        thing about using biomass is that those trees and plans absorbed a
        large part of this CO2 from the air during their lifetime.
