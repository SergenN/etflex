---------------------------

ETFlex aims to make the Energy Transition Model accessible to ordinary people
who want to learn more about the subject, as well as help QI better serve
educational users.

Most of the application is implemented in CoffeeScript and can be found in
/client, while Rails serves up little more than a REST API.

Installation
------------

 1. Copy config/database.sample.yml to config/database.yml. Edit any settings
    as necessary for your local machine.

 2. Use Ruby 1.9.3 p0 or newer.
    rbenv: `rbenv local 1.9.3-p0`
    RVM: Create an .rvmrc with "rvm gemset use 1.9.3" then `rvm rvmrc load`.

 3. `bundle install`
